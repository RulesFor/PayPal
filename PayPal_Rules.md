As great and useful as PayPal seems, it can quickly become a horror for any normal user if they do not follow PayPal's hidden "rules".
PayPal uses an algorithm for each user to detect weird behaviours.<br>
If abnormal behaviour gets detected, your account is at risk of being restricted or banned completely.<br>
No user wants a restricted or banned account for reasons they do not seem to understand.<br>
Therefore, you are able to read through rules in this document on how to behave if you do not want the algorithm to detect you as "weird behaving" or "possibly endangered", which could lead to an account restriction or suspension.

But before we list all necessary rules on how to behave if you do not want to algorithm to think you are suspicious, you first need to know what "verified" means and what it allows you to do. We will also explain how to get verified.

## 1.0 Verification

If you want to get verified, you need to do the following things:

 - Have **at least one** bank account **or one** credit card connected with your paypal account
 - You have verified your identity and age² (for example: by uploading your passport)
 - You have confirmed your E-Mail address (by clicking on the URL in the confirmation E-Mail you have received when creating the account - this is also necessary if you want to send/receive money at all)
 - **Not necessary** but helpful: your account is older than a year

**Extra points:** your account is a bussiness account (even less limitations, even lower risk of getting restricted, **BUT** you can not receive money through "Friends and Family")

² this may not be visible to you straight away. Some users will not be able to do this until their account gets restricted/banned where they are then forced to verify their identity and age in order to unrestrict their account.

## 1.1 Verification benefits

If you happen to have a verified account, **the behaviour rules still apply** to you!<br>
But the important part is: they do not apply to you as much anymore as they used to do.<br>
For example: a **non** verified account can (approximation due to our testing) receive a maximum of 100€ once per year.
If such transactions happen more frequently and with higher amounts, your non verified account is at a very high risk of being restricted or suspended.<br>
A verified account on the other hand may receive higher amounts of money and also more frequently.
But if you receive (for example) 1000€ per day and that for an entire year, your account still is at risk of being banned or restriced (since such usecases are very rare).<br>
**So: all rules still apply but they are less strict.**

## 2.0 Behaviour rules

Before reading through the rules: keep in mind that PayPal uses its algorithm a lot. So if something is not written down here and you are unsure if you should do it, ask yourself this question: If a human saw my activity and the "thing" i want to do, would it look strange to him? After asking yourself this question, decide if you want to proceed doing the planned "thing" or abort it.

1. **Do not log yourself into your PayPal account too often from different locations.** If you are (for example) on holiday and want to check your balance: it's okay. But if you do that more than 3 times or so, your account might get restricted for "someone else tried to log into your account" (they may think your account got hacked).
2. **Do not send/receive a lot of money in a short time.** I have already mentioned it in my example at the verification benefits. So: do not do it or you might get restricted or banned.
3. **Do not receive a lot of chargebacks from customers.** If you sell goods or are a livestreamer (for example), you may get customer chargebacks or complaints through PayPal that something was not right with their purchse or donation. If you get **a lot** of chargebacks in a very short time, your account will definitely get restricted or suspended. (PayPal thinks you do something illegal because you get so many chargebacks and therefore automatically locks your account).
4. **Do not reach nor come near the maximum transaction limits.** In the EU, the maximum transaction limits (the European law says so) are 2500€ per year (without verifying your age or identity). But PayPal already restricts your account if you have only done transactions worth around 1500€ (70% of what the law says).

## 2.1 Behaviour rules - Extra points:
Only do the following things, if it is possible for you. If it is not possible it is not a huge deal.<br>
But if you do it, you are basically the master of the algorithm.
 - Try to make regular transactions. If the algorithm sees that you sometimes get a lot of money and then your account is unused for months, it may look weird to the automated system. But if you do regular transactions (for example 20€ every week/month) the algorithm learns that you do regular transactions and therefore won't be suspecting you, if you send more than usual amounts of money to a different person once or twice.
 - Do not sign into your account unusually frequently. For example: if you normally sign in once a day, the algorithm will learn and accept that. But if you sign in 200 times once, it will look **very** weird to the algorithm.

## 3.0 Difference: Suspended or Restricted

We mentioned the words suspended (or also named banned) and restricted quite often didn't we?<br>
But what do they mean and what happens if you get suspended or restricted?<br>

## 3.1 Suspended/banned

If you get suspended, you are basically fucked.<br>
You can not log into your account anymore and therefore can not access your money.<br>
If you can prove your identity and age to the PayPal support, you may receive the money you had left on your PayPal account in half a year through bank transfer.

## 3.2 Restricted

If your account gets restricted, you have a problem (depending on where you got restricted).<br>
You didn't get that? See, the algorithm restricts people there, where they used their account the most suspiciously.<br>
**Examples:**<br>
 - If you did a lot of high-amount transactions in a short time, you will be unable to send or receive money. Everything else of your PayPal account may still be useable.
 - If you almost reached the allowed transaction limit (as mentioned earlier), your account (we tested that twice but your restrictions may be different) probably will be restricted in the following area: deletion.<br>
 In other words: you may be unable to delete or deactivate your account.


## 4.0 Disclaimer

Because this is not an official document, neither we nor you can prove we are right nor wrong.<br>
PayPal doesnt provide information about how they differentiate between "good" and "bad" users at all.<br>
**But** we did extensive testing where we figured out these behaviour rules.<br>
We and some friends lost (in total) 750€ whilst searching for things the algorithm doesn't like.<br>
We created a lot of PayPal accounts and most of them got restriced or suspended.<br>
But even if we can not prove the rules we found out, **it won't hurt you if you stick to them.**
